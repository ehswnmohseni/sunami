This robot is programmed with the telethon library, which helps you manage a proxy telegram channel.

The work of this robot is as follows:
1. Separate the proxies from the buttons
2. Dividing sending time into morning, noon and night with emoji
3. Placing the final text with a message that has the same format as your channel
4. Sending that message in your channel

Just note that if you are Iranian like me, you must use vpn in your system
